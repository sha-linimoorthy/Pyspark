# Flight Departure Delay Prediction using PySpark ML Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project focuses on utilizing PySpark's machine learning library (MLlib) to predict flight departure delays using logistic regression. By leveraging distributed computing capabilities and the robust feature set of PySpark ML, we aim to develop a predictive model that can assist airlines and passengers in anticipating potential delays.

## Key Components
- **PySpark MLlib:** Harnessing PySpark's MLlib module allows us to perform distributed machine learning tasks efficiently, making it ideal for handling large-scale flight datasets.
  
- **Logistic Regression:** We employ logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm, to model the likelihood of flight delays based on various features such as departure time, airline, weather conditions, and historical performance.
  
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracting and engineering relevant features from the flight dataset is crucial for training an accurate predictive model. PySpark ML provides a suite of tools for feature transformation and selection.
  
- **Model Evaluation:** We assess the performance of the logistic regression model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring the reliability of the predictions.

## Benefits
- **Scalability:** PySpark's distributed computing framework enables us to handle large volumes of flight data efficiently, making it suitable for real-world applications in the aviation industry.
  
- **Predictive Accuracy:** By leveraging logistic regression and carefully engineered features, our model aims to provide accurate predictions of flight departure delays, helping airlines optimize operations and improve passenger satisfaction.
  
- **Actionable Insights:** The predictive model can offer valuable insights into the factors contributing to flight delays, enabling airlines to take proactive measures to mitigate potential disruptions.

## Conclusion
Flight departure delay prediction using PySpark ML logistic regression represents a powerful application of big data analytics and machine learning in the aviation sector. By harnessing distributed computing capabilities and advanced modeling techniques, this project aims to deliver actionable insights and enhance operational efficiency for airlines and stakeholders.
